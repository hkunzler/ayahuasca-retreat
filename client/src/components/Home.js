        <h5>Welcome to Ascension Medicina.</h5>
        <p>
          This retreat is located in the heart of the Amazon Rainforest in the
          Peruvian jungle. I am dedicated to helping people become self
          empowered and connected back our sacred and powerful spirit. These
          intensive Ayahuasca and kambo retreats are designed to connect us back
          to the forgotten parts of our divinity and align us with the sacred
          and profound symbiotic relationship we have with nature. The focus is
          to help restore mind, body, and spirit, and align with our highest
          calling here on Earth. We are one. We are love. I am here to
          facilitate the breaking down of heavily programmed belief systems to
          further spiritual growth so we can actualize purpose in our lives.
          These retreats are 8 days long 5 Ayahuasca ceremonies and 2 Kambo
          Ceremonies and require you to show up fully to yourself. This retreat
          sits along the Amazon River and is energetically and spiritually
          charged. The Amazon has been a home for mother Ayahuasca to grow
          freely. Her medicinal powers have been used for centuries by native
          cultures to integrate deep understanding of Human spirit in
          correlation with Nature. We are one in the same. This retreat will
          help you begin to actualize purpose on the planet or help you deepen
          your connection with your spirit/soul. We are already enlightened and
          fully capable of whatever we wish to experience in this lifetime, we
          just need to peel back the barriers. We are here to help you along
          your journey and support your growth in safe, judgement free
          enviroment. I must say this has been the most powerful and
          transformative thing I have ever done. Mother ayahuasca is a healer
          and has been since the dawn of time. She can take your pain and make
          it small she will transform your fear into strength and sickness into
          new life. Her wisdom and love for you and her planet reaches far
          beyond the depths of imagination. She does not put up with your
          bullshit, she will show you everything and then some of the depthes of
          your being, she shows us where we are loosing sight of ourselves. She
          shows up our deepest fears, insecurities, and desires. She returns us
          home to the most sacred part of our being and transforms us back into
          the gods and goddesses we truly are. She showed me the great
          responsibility it is to be human and respect all life. She showed me
          her sadness of thousands of years of human programming and the
          devastation we have caused as humans. She cried for her planet. She
          showed me the most beautiful divine love I have ever experienced and
          made me realize that this love is all of us at every moment in time. I
          saw myself in the eyes of the creator. I saw god. I received the most
          beautiful visions of the world and the dimensions far beyond this one.
          This unseen world is constantly working in our favor if we can
          surrender what we know and accept the sacred. We traveled to a world
          of vision and clarity that is the truth of being alive. I saw my
          ancestors wounds and loves. I felt profound laughter and joy. I cried,
          I moved, and above all I loved more than ever. I felt the most ancient
          and divine energy of the feminine run through my being and show me my
          soul. This process is necessary for every living human. I purged all
          my baggage out through vomit. I gave my emotional baggage away in this
          purge process. Everyone usually purges to remove the layers of baggage
          and garbage that ails our souls. This isn't a scary trip out "drug"
          this is you. This is the truth. This is life and death. This is the
          divine creation showing us the way that we have long forgotten. This
          is who we are. I am beyond grateful for this life. My hope is that
          every human has the experience of knowing where you came from, the
          realms on unimaginable beauty and divine perfection. My hope is with
          this knowledge you will treat yourself with grand respect and love and
          in turn has that reflected on the planet.
